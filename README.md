PI: Jenny Amos, PhD (jamos@illinois.edu or git: jennyamos)

Mentor: Colin Castleberry, PhD

This tool is an interactive visualization of tag organized assessment data from a Gradescope course. Student data is not included in the repository, but the [MATLAB file](edgeFormat_zscore.mlx) references "student_data.csv", which contains all student grades for tag organized assessments in a course. Example data is provided by [Student 1](Student1.json) and [Student 2](Student2.json).

This project uses the [D3 force-directed graph](https://github.com/d3/d3-force) layout created by Mike Bostock.
